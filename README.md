# Imagegallery
A easy PHP image gallery Showing Filename, Filedate and Image


Just something i needed at work, and could not find any scripts that did exactly what i needed. the script does not create Thumbnails
Create a folder call it whatever you want and upload index.php and show_image.php Create a folder gallery-images and input your PNG files

Script requires only APACHE and PHP

When user open URL the script read the content of gallery-images folder and shows the 12 newest images from the gallery-images folder to the user


Example: Input PHP FILES HERE: /var/www/html/xray/66.01.00/
Create Gallery folder like this /var/www/html/xray/66.01.00/gallery-images


Feel free to edit my script as you like, Its open source, and should be open source forever... if you copy it and use it for free its great!
You are not allowed to implement and sell it, This script should always be free of charge!
